# TODO
- test server performance with many players
- bugfix: wool blocks turn into dirt blocks
- modern material vs. legacy material
- build initial structures as instructed by the architect

## Questions
- What should happen with their world when a player logs out?
- Are we interested in BlockDamageEvents?
