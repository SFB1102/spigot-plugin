# TODO
- test server performance with many players
- bugfix: wool blocks turn into dirt blocks
- modern material vs. legacy material
- build initial structures as instructed by the architect
- write a script that simulates 10 players joining
- make playerworlds smaller (50 * 50 or 20 * 20) --> worldborder, then don't load blocks outside of world border
- delete old player worlds. When the server is shutdown or the player logs out?


## Questions
- What should happen with their world when a player logs out? Their world can be deleted
- Are we interested in BlockDamageEvents?
