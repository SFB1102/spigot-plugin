# TODO
- bugfix: wool blocks turn into dirt blocks (has not happend since ground was changed to bedrock from grass)
- modern material vs. legacy material (this plugin uses modern material, the test plugin VirtualPlayers uses legacy material)
- build initial structures as instructed by the architect
- make playerworlds smaller (50 * 50 or 20 * 20) --> worldborder, then don't load blocks outside of world border
- delete old player worlds. When the server is shutdown or the player logs out?


## Questions
- What should happen with their world when a player logs out? Their world can be deleted
- Are we interested in BlockDamageEvents?
